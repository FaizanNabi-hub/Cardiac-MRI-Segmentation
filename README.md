# Cardiac-MRI-Segmentation
This study addresses left ventricle segmentation in Cardiac MRI using Encoder-Decoder architectures like Spatial Attention and U-Net, refined via dataset augmentation and tuning on the Sunny Brook dataset. Initial Dice and Jaccard coefficients of 0.4307 and 0.2834 improved to 0.8036 and 0.70. High GPU could push Dice above 0.9 and Jaccard above 0.8
